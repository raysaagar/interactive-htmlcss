Interactive HTML/CSS Web Demo
===================

Simple demo page to run arbitrary HTML and CSS.

Enter HTML and CSS in the text areas located on the page. 

Submitting the form will display the inputs on the bottom half of the page.

## TODOs ##
* sandbox css to the bottom div only - This is somewhat achieved by not tagging anything above the bottom div with anything simple
* fix styling
* create more dummy pages
*
